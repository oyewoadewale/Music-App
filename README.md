# Music-App

what i learnt and applied in this project


The app’s structure is suitable for a music player app.
Properly using array list and custom adapter to inflate views in multiple Activities.

Each button’s behavior is determined by an OnClickListener in the Java code rather than by the android:onClick attribute in the XML Layout.
Each views properly opens the intended activity using an explicit Intent.
Code is properly-formatted, readable and runs error-free.
